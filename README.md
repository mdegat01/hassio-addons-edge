## Add-ons provided by this repository

### &#10003; [Loki][addon-loki]

[Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) is a horizontally-scalable,
highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It
is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the
contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

### &#10003; [Promtail][addon-promtail]

[Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) is an agent
which ships the contents of local logs to a private [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki)
