# What's Changed

Loki addon has now been moved to its own [repository](https://github.com/mdegat01/addon-loki)!

Although still a beta, this add-on is also getting close to being release
ready. I will primarily be working on adding testing and CI here, it is
functional in my testing.

Although the Promtail one is still waiting for the next supervisor release for
the journald functionality so for now still a bit difficult to feed logs to
this add-on.
