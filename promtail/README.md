[Promtail][promtail] is an agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private
[Loki][loki] instance or [Grafana Cloud][grafana-cloud]. It is usually deployed
to every machine that has applications needed to be monitored.

â›” **Known Issue** - This add-on is waiting on upcoming supervisor functionality
to function, specifically [this PR](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/pull/2722).
Once that makes its way into the supervisor release I will update the add-on
to use the new `journald` config. Until then this add-on cannot scrape logs from
the system journal as promised. If you choose to use it before that you should set
`skip_default_scrape_config` to `true` and provide a file for `additional_scrape_configs`
as it will only be able to see log files created by add-ons.

## About

By default this addon version of Promtail will tail logs from the systemd
journal. This will include all logs from all addons, supervisor, home assistant,
docker, and the host system itself. In addition you can set it up to look for
local log files in `/share` or `/ssl` if you have a particular add-on that logs
to a file instead of to `stdout`.
