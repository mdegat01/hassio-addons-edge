# Home Assistant Add-on: Sharry

## Install

First add the repository to the add-on store (`https://github.com/mdegat01/hassio-addons`):

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog
with a specific repository URL pre-filled.][add-repo-shield]][add-repo]

Then find Sharry in the store and click install:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of a Supervisor add-on.][add-addon-shield]][add-addon]

## Access & Login

Sharry is setup to authenticate with Home Assistant by default. This means any
HA user can open the UI and login with their HA credentials. Each HA user will
have their own account in Sharry and their own shares.

The addon has disabled all other login methods and new user registration by default.
If you want to allow users to have accounts just with Sharry you can enable user
registration and other login methods using the `conf_overrides` option shown below.
You will need to configure one of the other login methods under `sharry.restserver.backend.auth`
and set `sharry.restserver.backend.signup.mode` to either `open` or `invite`. See
[Sharry coniguration][sharry-docs-configure] for more information.

## Database Setup

[Sharry][sharry] requires a Postgres or MariaDB database to store its data. By
default it will store its data in the [MariaDB addon][addon-mariadb]. That add-on
must be installed and running prior to start-up. You don't need any additional
configuration for this, as long as the MariaDB add-on is running this one can
use it.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of a Supervisor add-on.][add-addon-shield]][add-addon-mariadb]

If you prefer you can use a remote database by filling in all the `remote_db_*`
options below. You must create the database and operator for Sharry in advance
and Sharry will need full read/write access on the specified database so it can
set up the schema and manage the data.

Please note that there is no easy upgrade path between these two options.

## âš  Backing up Sharry

Since Sharry does not store its own data, snapshots of this add-on will only
include its configuration. You will need to separately back up the data in order
to restore. If you are using the MariaDB add-on then make sure to include that
add-on in your snapshot as well. If you are using a different database then you
will need to set up your own backup process.

## Configuration

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
domain: homeassistant.local
use_ssl: false
default_language: us
share_max_size_gb: 1.5
share_max_valid_days: 365
server_secret: changeme
log_level: info
conf_overrides:
  - property: sharry.restserver.webapp.welcome-message
    value: Happy sharing!
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `domain`

The domain users will access Sharry at. Sharry is given a base URL that it uses
for generating URLs and configuring cookies. That will be created from this option,
the `use_ssl` option, and the port you list for `9090`. If the port isn't listed
then the addon assumes users do not include a port in the URL when accessing Sharry.

### Option: `use_ssl`

If users will use SSL to access Sharry. Defaults to `false`.

**Note**: _Enabling SSL access is out of scope for Sharry. This option is for users
who use a reverse proxy and enable SSL there._

### Option: `access.add_port`

The port users will have to provide when accessing Sharry. If omitted, assumes
users will not provide a port in the URL when accessing Sharry.

### Option: `default_language`

An [ISO 3166-1][iso-3166-1] country code. Defaults to `gb` if omitted or if the
code provided is invalid or its language is unavailable to Sharry.

### Option: `share_max_size_gb`

Max size a share can be in GB. Defaults to `1.5` if omitted.

### Option: `share_max_valid_days`

Max number of days a share can be valid for. Defaults to `365` if omitted.

### Option: `server_secret`

Secret used to sign authenticator tokens generated for clients. Prefix it with
`hex:` to use a hexadecimal value or `b64:` to use a base64 encoded value.

### Option: `remote_mysql_host`

If using an external database, the hostname/address for the MariaDB/Postgres database.

### Option: `remote_db_type`

Only applies if a remote database is used, the type of database (`mariadb` or `postgres`).

### Option: `remote_db_port`

Only applies if a remote database is used, the port that the database server is
listening on.

### Option: `remote_db_database`

Only applies if a remote database is used, the name of the database.

### Option: `remote_db_username`

Only applies if a remote database is used, the username with permissions on that
database.

### Option: `remote_db_password`

Only applies if a remote database is used, the password of the above user.

### Option: `reset_database`

Set to `true` to delete and recreate the database on startup. As the data is held
within the MariaDB addon, it is not removed on an uninstall.

**Note**: _This option **only** applies if using the MariaDB add-on, it will not
try to drop a remote MySQL database. Also once the database is reset this configuration
option will be cleared automatically for the addon._

### Option: `conf_overrides`

Sharry's configuration is specified in [HOCON][hocon]. This means the values in
the config value can be overridden using java properties as described [here][hocon-docs-props].
This option lets you provide an array of config overrides to customize advanced
parts of Sharry's config which haven't been exposed as options above. You can see
the full set of available options here:

<https://eikek.github.io/sharry/doc/configure#default-config>

**Note**: _Changing these options can possibly cause issues with your instance.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

These are case sensitive and any items set by specific configuration will take
precedence. The ones which cannot be overridden are flagged with a comment in
the [default config][default-config] this addon uses.

#### Sub-option: `property`

The config property to set. Must be the full path starting from the root. Instructions
on handling arrays can be found [here][hocon-docs-arrays].

#### Sub-option: `value`

The value of the config property to set.
